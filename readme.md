# Usability testing by instructions vs. real-world scenarios
This project is part of the scientific paper *Comparison of usability testing by instructions and real-word scenarios* published in [Electrical Engineering and Informatics (EEI)](http://eei.fei.tuke.sk). The experiment was realized during May 2019.

## Prepared tasks and scenarios for experiment
For the experiment mentioned above, the authors used 3 different applications:

1. Accounting system, web app (initial experiment),
2. Sport tracking application, Android app (full experiment),
3. Private CMS system, web app (full experiment).

In these applications, usability testing was performed, in which the task and scenario testing approach was applied. Materials for both approaches have been created for each application (scenarios are in Slovak):

1. Accounting system
    - [Task-based approach](./acc-task.md)
    - [Scenario-based approach](./acc-scenario.md)
2. Sport tracking application (titled *Makacs*)
    - [Task-based approach](./makacs-task.md)
    - [Scenario-based approach](./makacs-scenario.md)
3. Private CMS system
    - [Task-based approach](./cms-task.md)
    - [Scenario-based approach](./cms-scenario.md)
